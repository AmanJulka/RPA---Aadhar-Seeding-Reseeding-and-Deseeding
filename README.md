## 👤 Aadhaar Seeding, Reseeding, and Deseeding Automation 🚀

###  Ensuring Seamless Government Benefit Disbursement 🏦 - Processing Thousands of Records Daily!

This project automated the critical process of Aadhaar Seeding, Reseeding, and Deseeding for YES Bank, ensuring smooth and accurate disbursement of government benefits to citizens.  The solution processes **thousands of records daily (2000-5000)**, eliminating manual effort, enhancing accuracy, and guaranteeing timely updates to the NPCI portal.

### 🎯 Requirement: Manual, Complex, and Time-Sensitive Aadhaar Updates

The existing process presented several challenges:

*   **😓 Manual Data Handling:**  Processing Aadhaar Seeding, Reseeding, and Deseeding requests was entirely manual.
*   **⏱️ Time-Consuming:** Manually creating three different files for Seeding, Deseeding, and Reseeding was a time-intensive task.
*   **⚠️ Error-Prone:** Manual file creation and data entry were susceptible to errors, potentially leading to incorrect updates on the NPCI portal.
*   **Multiple Systems Involved:** Data needed to be gathered from various systems like Newgen, Flexcube, and Aadhar Vault, adding complexity to manual processing.
*   **🔒 Security & Encryption:**  Output files needed to be encrypted using Express ACH tool before uploading to the NPCI portal, adding another manual step.
*   **📜 Regulatory Compliance:**  Accurate and timely updates to the NPCI portal are crucial for regulatory compliance and ensuring citizens receive government benefits without delays.

### 🤖 Automation Approach:  End-to-End Solution for Aadhaar Management

Our automation strategy delivered a comprehensive solution to streamline the entire Aadhaar update process:

*   **🔄 Data Extraction from Newgen:** 🤖 Bot starts by connecting to **Newgen application** to fetch daily customer data related to Seeding, Deseeding, and Reseeding requests.
*   **🔍 Customer Data Enrichment from Flexcube (FCR):** 🤖 Using Customer IDs from Newgen, the bot retrieves **Aadhaar tokens from Oracle Flexcube (FCR)**, enriching the data set.
*   **🔑 Aadhaar Number Retrieval via Aadhar Vault API:** 🤖 Bot then leverages **REST API integration with Aadhar Vault** to securely fetch the corresponding Aadhaar numbers for the retrieved Aadhaar tokens.
*   **📤 Generation of Three Output Files (.txt GEFU format):** 🤖 Bot intelligently processes the collected data and automatically generates **three distinct output files** in the required .txt GEFU format: Seeding File, De-seeding File, and Reseeding File.
*   **🔒 Encryption using Express ACH Tool:** 🤖 Bot utilizes **surface automation to interact with Express ACH encryption tool** and automatically encrypts the generated output files, ensuring data security as per NPCI requirements.
*   **🌐 NPCI Portal Upload via Web Automation:** 🤖 Bot leverages **web automation to access the NPCI portal** and upload the encrypted files, completing the critical update process.
*   **✅ Acknowledgement & File Management:** 🤖 Bot monitors the NPCI portal for upload acknowledgements. Upon successful upload, the bot **downloads and decrypts the acknowledgement files**, storing them securely in a designated shared drive.
*   **📧 Email Notifications:** 🤖  Irrespective of success or failure, the bot triggers **email alerts** to relevant stakeholders, providing key details like Request ID, date range, and timestamp for process monitoring and audit trails.
*   **📂 Organized File Storage:** 🤖 Bot maintains a well-organized file structure by storing input files (date-wise) and output files (decrypted files from NPCI, also date-wise) in designated shared drive locations, facilitating easy access and auditability.

### ✨ Role of Automation:  Ensuring Accuracy, Speed, and Compliance in Aadhaar Updates

Automation transformed the Aadhaar update process, making it efficient, reliable, and compliant:

*   **End-to-End Automation:** 🤖 Bot automates the entire process from data extraction to file upload and acknowledgement, eliminating manual intervention at every stage.
*   **High-Volume Processing:** 🤖  Handles **2000-5000 records daily** with ease, demonstrating its capacity to manage substantial daily workloads.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy:** 🤖 Automated data retrieval and processing significantly minimize human errors, ensuring accurate Aadhaar updates and reducing discrepancies.
*   **Accelerated Turnaround Time:** 🤖 Automation drastically reduces the processing time compared to the manual process, enabling faster updates to the NPCI portal and quicker disbursement of benefits.
*   **Improved Security and Compliance:** 🤖 Automated encryption and secure file handling ensure adherence to security protocols and regulatory guidelines for sensitive Aadhaar data.
*   **Proactive Monitoring and Communication:** 🤖 Automated email alerts provide timely updates and ensure proactive monitoring of the process, improving communication and transparency.
